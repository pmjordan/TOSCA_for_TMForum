# TOSCA_for_TMForum
TOSCA examples in support of IG1176 in the TMForum. 
The most recent updates are for IG1175v5, earlier work as in 

https://projects.tmforum.org/jira/browse/ODA-119 (Login on required)
and 

https://www.tmforum.org/resources/exploratory-report/ig1176-tosca-guide-for-model-driven-automation-r18-5-0/

There also is a fork of oda-119.yml which splits its content into three files; 
sid.yml contains the SID extentions to TOSCA
modularRouterProfile.yml contains an generic router profile 
and acme.yml which contains vendor specific extentions of them.

Also a [TOSCA representation of a firewall](TR255/vFirewall.yml) in for use in TR255C although that is superceeded by work in IG1176v5
