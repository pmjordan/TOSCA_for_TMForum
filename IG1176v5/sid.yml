        13: In Maintenance
        14: Unable To Contact
        15: Lost Communications

        Stopped indicates that the LogicalResource is known to still exist, but it is no longer operational. However, it has not failed.

        Stressed indicates that the LogicalResource is functioning, but needs attention (e.g., it may be overheating, or overloaded in some way). This is similar to Predicted Failure, which indicates that this LogicalResource is functioning properly, but is predicting a failure in the near future.

        In Maintenance indicates that this LogicalResource is being configured, maintained, or otherwise administered and is NOT available for service.

        Unable To Contact indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this LogicalResource but has never been able to establish communications with it. In contrast, Lost Communications indicates that the LogicalResource has been contacted successfully in the past and is known to still exist; however, it is currently unreachable."
